# shared-scripts

This repo stores generally used scripts and executables written by Olivia Lang and William KM Lai.

All of these scripts are written to be stand-alone and therefore more portable. You should be able to copy the `.py` file into your projects for execution (see comments and help statements for special package dependency info).

### ScriptManager prototyping

These can serve as the basis/prototype for new tools in scriptmanager. Olivia tries to move them to `z-archive` after they have been reimplemented in ScriptManager to reduce redundancy.

> The following scripts are untested and need to be verified as working:

>   |-- ğŸš§ append_BED.py
